Conditional branching: if-else block

List
List is used to store the sequence of various data type
These are mutable means we can modify the List
These are ordered and accessed by index
We can get the sub list using slicing:
list_variable(start:stop:step)
define by []

Tuple:
Same as List
These are immutable
define by ()

Set:
Set is a collection of unordered items
Elements must be unique
These are immutable
Duplicate values would be removed
Indexes are not used in Set
define by {}

Dictionary:
Key-valued pair.
