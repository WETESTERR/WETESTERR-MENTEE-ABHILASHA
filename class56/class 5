Object oriented programming in python (OOPs)
Classes > A template or a blue print
Objects > It is an instance of a class
Inheritance > Acessing properties of parent class in child class
Polymorphism > Same function name with different function structures. function has variables or body. Methods overloading(same body) or overriding(same args).

Abstraction/Interface > Hiding of code or exposing of code which is needed. Interface is 100% abstraction.
